## Objectives

The main objective of this research is to build an automated load forecasting tool for smart grid systems that can handle the dynamic challenges in energy demands and attain the maximum outputs. By integrating several advanced methodologies, the complete framework is developed that can perform the forecasting tasks reliably and efficiently.

## Datasets
In this study, four distinct datasets are utilized: the Panama Case Study Dataset, the Daily Electricity Price and Demand Dataset (Victoria, Australia), the Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset, and the Australia Load Dataset. 
Three augmentation techniques, including jittering, magnitude wrapping, and window slicing, are employed to increase the sample size and balance the dataset.
